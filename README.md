# Kulami_Game_Bot
This project's aim is to create a kulami game bot.

To run this project compile main.c to shared object (.so) and run the python file.

It currently only works for linux if you want it to work for different operating systems as well compile your code to the version that your OS uses and change the python file to make it choose that file.
